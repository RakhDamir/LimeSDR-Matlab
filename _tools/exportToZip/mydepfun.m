function filelist = mydepfun(fn,recursive)
%MYDEPFUN - Variation on depfun which skips toolbox files
%
% filelist = mydepfun(fn)
% filelist = mydepfun(fn,recursive)
%
% Returns a list of files which are required by the specified
% function, omitting any which are inside $matlabroot/toolbox. 
%
% "fn" is a string specifying a filename in any form that can be
%   identified by the built-in function "which".
% "recursive" is a logical scalar; if false, only the files called
%   directly by the specified function are returned.  If true, *all*
%   those files are scanned to, and any required by those, and so on.
%
% "filelist" is a cell array of fully qualified file name strings,
%   including the specified file.
%
% e.g.
%     filelist = mydepfun('myfunction')
%     filelist = mydepfun('C:\files\myfunction.m',true)
